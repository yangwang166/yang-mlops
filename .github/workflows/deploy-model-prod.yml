# This GitHub workflow performs model deployment to production
# The workflow contents are largely the same as deploy-model-staging.yml but
# we split staging and prod model deployment into separate workflows to simplify
# separately tracking and viewing staging and prod model deployments via GitHub UI and API
#
# This workflow is triggered in an automated manner by the model training job (see notebooks/TriggerModelDeploy.py)
# after model training completes, to enable tracking and enforcing manual approval of model deployments in
# CD, if desired.
